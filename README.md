# Python-Degrees-of-Separation
Networks can represent a lot of real-world enes and can explain certain phenomena. In this project for a course at Washington & Jefferson College, I investigated some graph theory and degrees of separation.

Where Did I Get the Informaon from?
Part one:

Part two:

What did I do and what did I implement?
Basically, updated all the code in MastranGraph3.py and then made this report document from it. None of the methods in MastranGraph3.py had any code in it. Just comments. I followed the Cornell links above as a guide to my project. Because there is not too much math involved, more than discussed above, I will write about here how I implemented the code. For most of the implementaon, I did not always follow the comments. I basically implemented all the code for the following methods (they can be found in MastranGraph3.py):
